Doing your homework is an inescapable responsibility. You must set the time and resources for your assignments to succeed at school. If, after reading this article, you’re still asking, “Why can&#8217;t I focus on my homework?” then your problem could be more complicated. It would help if you thought about your mental state and health.<span id="more-387"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Can&#8217;t I Focus on Homework?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several key reasons why college and university students can’t focus on home assignments. Below, we offer some of the most common issues that may stand behind you next college home assignment failure: </span></p>
<p><b>Distractions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">External noises, siblings, social media messages, and many other issues can distract you from the task at hand. </span></p>
<p><b>Procrastination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Putting off tasks until the last minute can create a sense of urgency, but it can also lead to major stress and decreased focus. </span></p>
<p><b>Fatigue. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of sleep and tons of home assignments cause severe fatigue that doesn’t let young people concentrate on the tasks that should be accomplished within the deadline. </span></p>
<p><b>Lack of structured routine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. College students wondering how to focus better on homework are usually the ones who don’t have a consistent routine and structured environment. </span></p>
<p><b>Multitasking. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to write an essay, listen to music, and chat with your pals at the same time may lead you to a homework failure.</span></p>
<h2>The Best Ways to Focus on Homework</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to focus on homework? Provide the right place first. </span>When focusing on homework, the first thing to do is find a quiet space free from distraction. If you have a private room in your house, that may be the best place to start. If this isn&#8217;t an option, you can try other ways of creating a distraction-free space. For example, you could try wearing noise-canceling headphones. If you don&#8217;t have a desk or table, find a quiet corner where you won&#8217;t be disturbed. Keep it tidy to stay focused on your work and not the mess around you. Try to set a specific time each day to focus on your homework. This way, you&#8217;ll know you have a particular time to finish your task, freeing up other unnecessary responsibilities from your schedule. This will help you stay on track and get the most out of your time.</p>
<h2>How to Stay Focused on Homework in a Disruptive Environment</h2>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re wondering, &#8220;How do I focus on my homework in a disruptive environment?&#8221; or &#8220;How can I <a href="https://domyassignments.com/">do my homework</a> in unsettled circumstances?&#8221; The truth is that if you have many distractions at home or in your dorm, you may be unable to stay focused on your homework. If this happens, try going to a library or a coffee shop where you can work peacefully. Libraries are great for this purpose because they have comfortable chairs, quiet spaces, and no Wi-Fi. This will help you focus on your work instead of being distracted by other people&#8217;s conversations. If you can&#8217;t leave the house <span style="font-weight: 400;">and wonder how to focus on school work in the comfort of your home</span>, try creating a distraction-free zone in a quiet part of the house. You could try turning the television off and keeping cell phones out of sight. This will help you stay focused on your work. If you have noisy roommates or family members, try getting them involved in other things. You could ask them to keep the television volume low or their voices down while you work. Reading in open spaces is also an option.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to concentrate on homework and breathe some fresh air? </span>You can set the table under a tree and read. This is especially great in the morning and evening when the sun is warm and the breeze is cool. Some people enjoy reading in nature while observing birds, butterflies, and other small animals. Try it out and see if it can work for you. Smartphones have become one of the leading sources of distraction today. If you’re addicted to your phone and find it hard to put it aside, you must learn how to control that addiction. Set days or hours when your phone is in a no-go zone. Otherwise, your productivity will remain severely impacted.</p>
<h2>Top 6 Apps That Help You Focus on Homework</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of apps to help you focus on homework. Here are five proven to help people concentrate better and earn better grades.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Focus:</b> This app trains you to become more productive by helping to reduce the urge to procrastinate. It is ideal for students who have trouble focusing on their work. It allows you to get more out of your time to avoid the stress of last-minute assignments. It is available on Android, iPhone, and other devices.</li>
<li><b>Self-Control:</b> This app allows you to block certain websites, such as social media and video streaming sites, that can distract you from your work. You can set a specific time for the app to end so you can still enjoy your social time in the evening. It is also available on Android, iPhone, and other devices.</li>
<li><b>Forest:</b> This app encourages you to stay focused on your work by making you plant a virtual tree. Once you have planted the tree, you must wait for it to grow before you can go back to the app and end your session.</li>
<li><b>Headspace:</b> This app provides guided meditation and mindfulness exercises for the body and mind. With this app, you can get into a healthy routine that will help you focus on your work. Remember, a healthy routine is critical for a healthy mind. Once your body adapts to wholesome routines, completing repetitive tasks becomes pretty easy.</li>
<li><b>Pomodoro technique:</b> This app was invented to improve productivity by breaking down work time into intervals of 25 minutes, separated by short breaks. You set a timer for 25 minutes and then work until it goes off, take a break for 5 minutes, then repeat the process four more times before taking a more extended break of 15-30 minutes or more. This technique helps you stay focused on your work by breaking it down into manageable chunks. There are short breaks between sessions so your brain can recharge and be ready to tackle the next section of your homework assignment with renewed energy.</li>
<li><b>Focus Keeper:</b> This app helps you stay focused by making it difficult to switch windows or applications when working if it remains open. For instance, if you’re reading an eBook, it will lock the app and prevent you from switching to a social media site even if you receive a notification. And when used on a computer, it stops you from navigating to a new page while doing your homework.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s one thing to think about the amazing ideas, and it’s totally another thing to put them into action. The same situation may occur in writing either a novel or an assignment. Let&#8217;s face it, almost every famous writer can be found in a situation when he/she is supposed to write something creative, but the mind goes blank. What to speak about a student who is assigned to many different tasks?</p>
<p><span id="more-86"></span></p>
<p>Irrespective of whether you are in middle or high school, or in a university, once in a while, you can be required to engage in creative writing activities. What is creative writing? It is just a form of writing that uses the creativity of mind to express emotions, thoughts, or feelings. Whereas the other pieces of writing focus more on giving facts and analyzing issues, the creative writing pieces are all about entertaining, spreading, or expressing thoughts.</p>
<h2>Creative Writing Assignments for College Students</h2>
<p>If you think you are done with creative writing after graduating high school <span style="font-weight: 400;">and will never catch yourself thinking, “Who can </span><a href="https://domyassignments.com/samples.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do my assignment for me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?”</span>, think twice. Even at the college level, some examiners tend to stimulate the creativity of students. For example, the professors at the College of Charleston managed to set up <a href="http://today.cofc.edu/2014/12/05/8-creative-assignments-make-finals-kind-awesome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some exciting projects</a> that made students forget the stress of exams at the end of the semester. The examples of creative assignments at college may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a short story or poem that incorporates a specific theme or word</li>
<li>Creating a script for a short film or play</li>
<li>Developing a character and writing a series of journal entries from their perspective</li>
<li>Analyzing and reimagining a classic piece of literature or art</li>
<li>Collaborating with classmates to write and perform a spoken word piece <span style="font-weight: 400;">or any other </span><a href="https://domyassignments.com/samples.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assignment example</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you need inspiration for a college assignment or want to improve your creative writing skills, <a href="/samples.html">these sample assignments can help you</a> get started. Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact your professors or an assignment writing service for additional support and guidance.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ffff;">Archaeological Dig for History/Culture/Art and Design Courses</span></h3>
<p>This activity allows students to imagine being active archaeologists. They have to write about something they come across when excavating. They need to describe in detail what they excavate and state its significance in modern world history or culture.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ffff;">Questionnaire-Based Survey Taker for Social Sciences</span></h3>
<p>Students studying Psychology or Sociology must deal with statistical data. As a rule, they are asked to create a questionnaire for different purposes &#8211; collect measurable data from a specific group of people. There is no specific format for a questionnaire/survey, and students have to use their own creativity.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ffff;">Poems for a Literature Course</span></h3>
<p>If you are taking a literature course at a college, you are likely to be asked to <a href="https://www.fortcherry.org/cms/lib03/PA01000874/Centricity/Domain/71/Poetry%20-%20911/Adv.Engl.PoetryAssignment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">write a poem as an assignment</a>. To score high marks for your poetry assignment, you have to be extra creative and consider all the aspects of the <a href="https://slcharlton.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/poetry-writing-assignment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poem evaluation</a>.</p>
<h2>High School Creative Writing Assignments</h2>
<p>A good teacher should also encourage your creativity at the high-school level. So, how can you be tested for creative assignments in a high school?</p>
<p>To be tested on your creative writing skills in high school, you may be asked to participate in various activities and assignments, such as writing prompts, group brainstorming sessions, and peer reviews. These assignments can help you develop your writing skills, express your ideas and thoughts, and explore different genres and styles. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask your teacher or seek assistance from a writing tutor or assignment writing service for additional support and guidance. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Both a competent professor and trusted </span><a href="https://domyassignments.com/service.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assignment writing services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are there to facilitate your academic journey. </span></p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">One-Sentence Story</span></h3>
<p>Have you ever heard from your educator, “Speak quickly as I’m in a hurry now”? As a rule, you must formulate your ideas as briefly as possible. The same task is in the given creative activity &#8211; you are only given one sentence and are required to use all your creativity to come up with a complete story. Read <a href="https://www.scoopwhoop.com/inothernews/one-line-stories/#.ozas9icqy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">15 amazing 1-line stories</a> to have an idea what you’re required.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">Writing a Spontaneous Speech</span></h3>
<p>At <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/be-better-spontaneous-speaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>, you’ll find the article by a lecturer on the essentials of strategic communication, Matt Abrahams, who states that spontaneous public speaking is much more prevalent than planned speaking, especially in the business area. A speech should address a particular audience, meaning you must select your vocabulary carefully. Besides, you also have to be creative and make your speech enjoyable to listen. In the estimation of most tutors, it is better to be still ready for these off-the-cuff conversations by writing a speech, then producing it in real-life conditions.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">Creative Imaginary Story Writing</span></h3>
<p>In many creative writing workshops, you’ll find the task of crafting creative compositions. You may ask, “Every day I write my compositions, and my creativity scope is limited to strict academic requirements”. In fact, things are different when writing a creative story. Students are given a topic and required to create an imaginary story. In the first instance, you can be asked to finish a story. Then, you’ll need to come up with a story based on some pictures, melodies, etc. Every piece of writing has to correspond to the topic as you imagine it, at the same time, be informative and interesting to read.</p>
<h2>Creative Writing Assignments for Middle School Students</h2>
<p>Students’ creativity is an important ability in middle school. There, students are taught to use their imagination to produce new ideas. What assignments can test your creativity in middle school?</p>
<p>Students can benefit from assignments encouraging them to write in different genres or styles, such as science fiction, mystery, or historical fiction. Students can also practice their descriptive writing skills by creating vivid settings or characters or experimenting with different points of view. Collaborative assignments, such as creating a class anthology or magazine, can help students develop teamwork and communication skills. Remember, these assignments aim to test your creativity, help you develop your writing skills, and express yourself in new and exciting ways.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Creative Essay Writing</span></h3>
<p>Students are required to be creative when addressing a specific topic. For example, the topic of the essay can be “What does it mean to be a feminist?” This particular essay addresses a specific niche and requires students to use their creativity to come up with fresh ideas on what to include and what not to include in the essay.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Open-Ended Imaginative Screenplays</span></h3>
<p>This form of creative writing allows students to express their thought freely and creatively <span style="font-weight: 400;">without sticking to particular assignment ideas</span>. There are no requirements to follow, no specific issues to solve, and no pressure to produce a finished version. you can write on an open-ended topic. It is a great starting point for you if you dream of being a famous scriptwriter or simply a creative person at work. Learn to be a step ahead, and this step you should take in your middle school. <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel stuck, consult the </span><a href="https://domyassignments.com/service.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best assignment writing service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to guide you. </span></p>

<h2>5 Ways of How to Improve Your Creative Writing Skills</h2>
<p>If you feel uncertainties about whether your creative writing skills correspond to high standards, it is better to improve them by taking into consideration several effective tips:</p>
<h3>1) Read a Lot</h3>
<p>If you want to improve your writing creativity <span style="font-weight: 400;">and find out more about the existing modes of creative writing</span>, you have to read a lot. You can read English storybooks, find various stories online or even read works from your more creative friend. Today, many creative people have the possibility to keep a blog from which they can take some creative ideas for their assignments. When reading, pay attention to the plot of the story to grasp the author&#8217;s thoughts and feelings. If you come across any word that you are not familiar with, write it on a piece of paper and find its meaning in a dictionary, for example, in <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Oxford Dictionary</a> or any other that is reliable enough.</p>
<h3>2) Rewrite a Story</h3>
<p>Rewriting is one of the most effective ways to improve your creative writing skills <span style="font-weight: 400;">and handle all the assignment writing for students like a pro</span>. Don’t get surprised that rewriting can help you become creative as rewriting involves using your own words or paraphrasing. Don’t act in such a way. If you find a good story/article interesting, rewrite it according to your preferences or vision. Use different characters and words and different views of the plot.</p>
<h3>3) Keep a Personal Journal</h3>
<p>You don’t know how creative you can be until you keep a personal journal. If something interesting, heartbreaking, or boring happens, write it down in your personal journal<span style="font-weight: 400;">, even if it’s something like, “I need to write my assignment, and that’s trouble.”</span> There is no restriction on what you can write in your personal diary, which gives an avenue for creativity. For more effectiveness, ensure that each and every day, you write something in the journal. You will be surprised at how creative you are when you actually read your own journal one month later.</p>
<h3>4) Play Imaginative Games</h3>
<p>Don’t think that playing games is a great excuse for you to get lazy just because you can improve your creativity only by playing imaginative games, not computer ones.  But sometimes, these games can also help you <span style="font-weight: 400;">with creative writing assignments</span>. What are these imaginative games? For example, ‘What Happens Next?’, ‘Renaming’, ‘Opposites’ or a <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/be-creative-a-game-adult-learners-31400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">game of I S-A</a>. Other than going out to a party or chatting on social media, use this precious time to play a game that will help enhance and improve your creativity. This will be like killing one bird with two stones. It’s a nice way to refresh your mind while, at the same time, you will be working on your creativity.</p>
<h3>5) Use Creative Writing Prompts</h3>
<p>The best way to do so is through constant practice, <span style="font-weight: 400;">not only when you’re thinking “I need to find new creative assignment ideas.”</span> Don’t wait for the moment when you will be in an exam room. Try out the following <a href="https://thewritepractice.com/creative-writing-prompts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">10 examples of prompt ideas</a> no matter where you are studying &#8211; in a college, high or middle school.</p>

<p dir="ltr">College is all fun until students start getting assignments &#8211; a lot of complex assignments. Most students struggle with their homework and, sometimes, this costs them dearly in getting the overall grade for a term. Have the same state of matters? You are welcome to the academic world where you can say, “My name is &#8230;, and I’m an underachieving student too”. Since you can’t avoid assignments, the only option left is to learn the various stages of writing an assignment.</p>
<p><span id="more-110"></span></p>
<p>This article is to help you with all the essential stages of writing. Eventually, you’ll manage to write your own assignment quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>How to Start a Writing Assignment: 3 Easy Pre-writing Steps</h2>
<p>In the estimation of many students, the hardest part of writing any assignment is starting it. This is so largely true due to the fact that there are some basic steps that every student should take before starting to write an assignment. The problem with the majority of students is that they wait until the last minute to complete the assignment.  After that, they write the first sentence, and then delete it because they don’t like how it sounds. Then, they sit staring at a blank piece of paper without knowing what should come first in an essay or research paper. A familiar situation to you?</p>
<p>The problem with that is that you focus more on completing the assignment within the set timeframe and pay no attention to the stages of your writing:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment.jpg" alt="How to Start a Writing Assignment" width="512" height="235" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h3>Let’s focus on the pre-writing steps. Before you start writing the introduction to your assignment, you should:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><u><strong>Understand the question</strong></u> &#8211; <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">know what you’re required to do</span>;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><u><strong>Have a plan</strong></u> &#8211; <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">find out what you’re able and want to cover</span>;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><u><strong>Come up with your thesis statement</strong></u> &#8211; <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">state what it is expected of a paper</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>Understanding the Assignment Question</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.nwp.org/cs/public/download/nwp_file/15410/Writing_Assignment_Framework_and_Overview.pdf?x-r=pcfile_d" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Writing Assignment Framework and Overview</a> by the National Writing Project, a writing assignment is a writing task for students that can involve:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question.jpg" alt="Understanding the Assignment Question" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before you can even write anything, you must understand the topic question. If you understand the assignment question, then you can’t go off the topic. Ask yourself questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">What is the assignment about</span></strong> &#8211; a narrative or reflective essay?</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">What is required of you</span></strong> &#8211; to analyze or evaluate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Check for some keywords such as compare, contrast, discuss… These words will give you a clear picture of what the examiner expects of you. If there is any word used that you don’t understand, take an initiative and find out what it means. If time is sufficient, consult your lecturer for further clarification. It might be so unfortunate to discover later that you didn’t understand the topic/assignment and, therefore, fail to perform that your educator requires. See if the assignment paper has words that limit you or if it is an open-ended question. Students who spend ample time understanding the assignment end up writing a good assignment and scoring high.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>Have an Effective Plan for an Assignment</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">After you catch the question under discussion, you should plan your assignment. Look at it again and determine <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write assignment in the most efficient manner</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #00ccff;">Word count</span></strong> &#8211; the ability to write under the precise terms of an assignment is highly appreciated. So don’t write less or more than it is required in your assignment;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #00ccff;">Information sources</span></strong> &#8211; the ability to use appropriate sources of information in your academic paper shows its credibility. So, it is in your interests to find the reliable sources from which you could take some facts or data;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #00ccff;">Format peculiarities</span></strong> &#8211; the knowledge of formatting academic works <span style="font-weight: 400;">based on the assignment steps</span> influences their way of presentation to your readers (instructors, professors, young researchers, etc.) So, if you want to present your term paper, follow the style guide during the writing process. There is nothing complex to put the comma where it is required by one or another formatting style (APA, MLA, Harvard, etc.);</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #00ccff;">Time is needed to come up with a brilliant paper</span></strong> &#8211; the strong time management skills influence your academic performance. So, if you budget your time effectively, there are more chances to get the great results.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment.jpg" alt="Planning an Assignment" width="512" height="92" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment-300x54.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Every college student can attest to the fact that when it comes to assignments, it is essential to know what and how to do them. Plan every step so that it helps you complete your assignments.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>Come Up with a Thesis Statement</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">A thesis statement is undeniably the most important statement in an assignment, <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the core parts of assignment</span>. The thesis statement declares your stand on the topic, and this is also the statement that guides your readers to your writing assignment. Take into consideration the writing tips on thesis statements from <a href="http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/tips/thesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the center for writing studies</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, you should formulate a clear thesis statement even before you begin writing the assignment itself. Specify your opinion concerning the main essay idea. Secondly, avoid generic statements. Specific word choice sharpens and clarifies your thesis statement. Be careful when coming up with a thesis statement as a wrong thesis statement is a recipe for failure. You are likely in favor of another way &#8211; the way towards the academic success.</p>
<h2>What to Include in My Essay: 3 Parts of My Paper</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Different parts are present in different types of academic papers (be it a lab report, literature review, research paper, and so on). Let’s consider 2 main types of assignment writing &#8211; an essay and research paper. If we speak about an essay assignment, you are supposed to include the introduction, main body, and the conclusion. If you need to write a coursework, it has more parts &#8211; abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Essays-vs-Research-paper.jpg" alt="Different parts Essays vs Research paper" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Essays-vs-Research-paper.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Essays-vs-Research-paper-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>Writing an Introduction is Half the Battle with Your Assignment</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Every academic paper starts with the introduction. There is no escaping from it as the introductory paragraph determines if you are on the right writing track or simply don’t understand the topic question. There is no debate about the importance of the introduction. Every student has to know how to write an introduction to an assignment, be it is an essay or term paper. The introduction should communicate the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">Contextual background of the topic</span></strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">.</span> The first point that you should give in the introduction of your assignment is the background of the topic. Write down the topic in your own words to make sure that you understand it. One of the mistakes made by most students while writing the introductory paragraph is that they repeat the assignment question word for word. This should not be the case if you want to impress your reader from the beginning. You are also required to find supportive materials from the credible authors who have written on the topic previously to support your contextual background;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">Stand on the issue</span></strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">.</span> You are expected to give an outline of the main ideas that you are going to discuss in the assignment. For example, if you cover the health care reform in your country, focus on the question “What&#8217;s your position on health care reform?” Write down some points concerning this issue. Usually, there should be two or more arguments that are opposite each other, then you should mention your own opinion backing up with strong evidence (research results in the form of statistics will come in handy);</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">The thesis statement</span></strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">.</span> We’ve already pointed out this important part of your essay. Remind you to work efficiently on it because it answers your topic question. Besides, remember the thesis statement’s position &#8211; it should be the last sentence in the introduction paragraph. Students must get the thesis statement right if they want to score high in that particular assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there are many common mistakes among students while dealing with the introduction. Below, you’ll see some of them so that you could avoid them in your writing. Moreover, there are ways of writing a good introduction.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment.jpg" alt="mistakes of writing an Assignment" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>The Main Body Makes 80% of Your Assignment</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The body of your essay is the main part where you present all your arguments, analyze them in a logical and orderly manner. In other words, this is the part that can allow you either to win or reduce your grades. The structure of the main part should be:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">Topic sentence</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">.</span> Every paragraph of the main body should start with a sentence that introduces the main idea in the sentence. Each paragraph gives a new idea. The topic sentence should communicate the intention of the paragraph to the reader.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">Evidence in the form of quotations and research studies</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">.</span> After presenting the topic sentence, you have to provide the strong evidence to support the main idea. The evidence should be in the form of citations, quotations or previous research studies.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">Concluding sentence</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc66;">.</span> While talking about the specific topic idea in the paragraph, you should arrive at the conclusive sentence. <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you check out any steps of assignment writing example, you will see that</span> you should link all your ideas discussed in the paragraph(s) to your thesis statement.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3>The Conclusion Leaves Your Readers with the Final Impression</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to heave a sigh of relief when it comes to writing a conclusion, you will go wrong. Despite that this is the final paragraph of your assignment, it is not less important to formulate all of your essay’s main points once again. However, your task is to explain briefly the major ideas that you have discussed in the main body. The evidence you presented in the main body dictates what you will talk about in the conclusion. The last sentence of your conclusion paragraph should answer the topic question in a direct way. Avoid presenting new ideas in the conclusion paragraph.</p>
<p>After reading all this, the only thing standing between you and good grades is following all these tips. Start implementing what you have read today in our article, and assignments will no longer be a problem for you.</p>

<h2>How to Complete Homework Fast and Effectively</h2>
<h3>Here are a few universal tips for executing assignments quickly.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enlist your tasks.</strong> Your objective number one is to take into account every task you have. Create a list of academic and non-academic tasks and duties. It’s important to prioritize all of them. Reconsider what is important and real. Throw out all the things that don’t mean something to you. Try to keep to the list and never violate the plan.</li>
<li><strong>It’s also vital to consider the time.</strong> Predict how long every assignment should take and complete all the points as quickly as possible. Be a realist and don’t try to manage too many projects during a day. Set realistic goals and achieve them. It’s simple math, which helps to be quicker and organized.</li>
<li><strong>Have the proper materials.</strong> To be quick and effective enough, you should organize every step. Of course, you ought to take into account learning materials. Think about all the things that may be useful while you study. These may be pens, paper, notebook, laptop or PC, etc. When we have helpful tools at hand, we don’t waste time on finding them. Make sure everything is at hand, and all that is left for you is to reach out your hand.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid distraction</strong>s. Almost every person has some habits that interfere with what s/he does. Students are no exception, and they tend to make things that slow them down. At times, the distractions bring them to a full stop, which is a killer to their work. Reconsider everything you do and try to avoid things that don’t belong to the learning process. Turn off all your devices, don’t talk too much to people who surround you, don’t play video games, keep away from social media, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Manage your time.</strong> You ought to control your time perfectly. As we have already mentioned above, your list should include all the tasks you have and predict the timeline. Schedule every step you are to undertake. It’s better to make small plans. Every essay, research paper, and other learning projects are supposed to have a clear deadline. Outline the beginning and the end of your projects. Thus, you’ll never forget about something important, and you won’t be stuck because you always know what comes next.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Get Homework Done at the Last Minute</h2>
<p>There are a few <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Your-Homework-Done-Fast" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more prompts</a>, which will make you quicker. They will help you emotionally, which is also essential <span style="font-weight: 400;">when you wonder how to finish homework fast</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be positive.</strong> No matter how many assignments you have and how difficult they are, don’t grow desperate. Think positively and cheer yourself up all the time long. Undertake things you love and like, hang out with your friends, travel, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Stay motivated.</strong> If you feel you lose motivation, try things that encourage you. These may be your hobbies. Besides, ask your friends or family members to help you. They may fulfill a few tasks together with you or simply cheer you up. Try the help of online writing companies. They may support you when you have no other option. They execute orders very fast and don’t violate the deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> Many students forget to rest properly. They work on and on and don’t stop. Sooner or later, they’ll get exhausted. Our mind and body require some rest. Therefore, take short breaks while you study.</li>
<li><strong>Eat and drink.</strong> Sustain your system with the help of snacks and water. Eat on a regular basis and stick to a healthy diet. Don’t overdrink caffeine.</li>
<li><strong>Reward yourself.</strong> Every task you complete is a small victory of yours. Reward yourself in some proper way each time you accomplish some complex project or several small assignments. Thus, you’ll be always motivated and focused.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Finish Homework Fast?</h2>
<p>Here are a few more quick tips and tricks. They are quite effective and can be used in different situations. If you follow them orderly, you sufficiently enhance the speed of executing any task. Make allowances for the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use technology.</strong> The resourcefulness of technology is undeniable. There are lots of smart devices, which can help to solve many learning difficulties. Thus, you can upload some time managing applications like Evernote and similar ones. These are digital calendars that help to track all the steps and tasks. Set reminders, add subheadings and descriptions, schedule the entire day, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Find a special place.</strong> To optimize your working process, study in some special place that saves you from all sorts of interference. It may be your private room, a lovely café, a family cottage, library, or something of the kind. When no one and nothing disturbs, you work faster and more productively.</li>
<li><strong>Define the most active hours.</strong> People have different working regimes. Some are more productive during the day time. The others show miraculous results at night. Try to complete most of your tasks during the most productive period of time.</li>
<li><strong>Begin to work before you come home.</strong> To get your HW done faster, start to work right at school, college, or university. While you’re on a break, begin to complete at least something. Even if you’re already on your way home, imagine the plan of future actions you’ll undertake to finish your assignments. It’s a pretty fruitful method.</li>
<li><strong>Control every step</strong>. Schedule every step you undertake. Try to reconsider all the things you do and stop doing time-consuming and really meaningless things like playing computer games, watch stupid videos, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Get some helpers.</strong> Sometimes, we aren’t able to finish all tasks on time even if we’re really quick. To avoid serious problems, always have some friends for extra cases. Besides, you can use some online help from paper writing services. They are dependable, effective, and very fast. Thus, you’ll manage even the most urgent assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this list, as well as other recommendations we’ve highlighted above. Some of them are quite obvious, but it doesn’t mean they are less effective. Don’t delay until the last minute to be sure you’re on time. Try to follow as many guidelines as possible. Thus, you’ll become focused, organized, and of course, extremely fast.</p>

<p>The majority of students fail since they go directly to writing the assignment without some proper preparation for the writing process. As a rule, this is always a recipe for failure in the academic world. Don’t expect such bad results? Then, take into consideration our following tips at each writing stage.</p>
<h2>#1 Pre-Writing Tips</h2>
<p>Writing assignments should be taken with full attention and seriousness you can. And you are capable of doing anything &#8211; even to write an essay at the last minute if only you know how to write an assignment on a topic. Primarily, you should prepare yourself for the task in the following ways:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/time-needed-for-assignment-writing.jpg" alt="time for assignment writing" width="512" height="342" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/time-needed-for-assignment-writing.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/time-needed-for-assignment-writing-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #66ccff;">Use time management skills.</span></strong> The first thing that you should do is to plan your time needed for assignment writing. This time shouldn’t include any other activities &#8211; being on the phone, eating or any other things you like to do. There are numerous distractions, for example, games, TV shows, and social media sites. If you wait until the last minute to do the assignment, then spend this time watching a YouTube channel, the chances that you will deliver the high-quality work are minimal. You will be more focused on beating the deadline rather than writing a good assignment. Plan your time according to our professional approach.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #66ffff;">Analyze the assignment question.</span></strong> Before you start writing anything, you have to understand the question that you need to answer. Only after the full understanding of the topic question, you can go ahead to write a good essay. Read the assignment topic carefully word by word. If there is any word that you are not familiar with, find its meaning in the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionary</a> or any other definition dictionary you wish. Even native English speakers can apply this way of clarifying words/phrases, not to speak about international ones who have just started learning English. If you can’t do it yourself, ask your friends or the lecturer for clarification. Imagine you need to write <a href="https://www.monash.edu/rlo/quick-study-guides/writing-a-critical-review" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a critical review</a> on the scholar article. Be on the lookout for limiting words like ‘analyze the scope of the issue’, ‘evaluate the merits of the text’, ‘judge the arguments’, etc. Pay attention to everything that makes the assignment more specific.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ff99ff;">Understand how marks are awarded.</span></strong> Most students don’t check the guide on how marks will be awarded for writing an essay or research paper. Good students go through the essay assessment checklist to determine what the examiner is looking for when assessing the assignment. This helps students to focus on the relevant fields that will win them marks. Look at the typical <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/pjlynch/essay-assessment-rubric" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">essay assessment template</a> and work on those points that are weak in your essays.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ccffcc;"><strong>Look for reliable information.</strong> </span>After understanding the topic and how marks are awarded, start hunting for information that will be useful for your assignment. You can get some credible information either from books or the Internet. Do you like to do everything digitally? No time to visit the university library? Great! You can find some reliable data if you follow the following guidelines.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff33;">Draft an outline.</span></strong> Even a rough outline of your assignment shows how to structure it in a logical way. This structure ensures that you keep on the right track and don’t go off topic. If you don’t know how to make an outline for your assignments look for a relevant outline sample. In fact, it is possible to use any sticky notes at hand or draw diagrams for a quick effect. Read <a href="https://piktochart.com/blog/5-psychology-studies-that-tell-us-how-people-perceive-visual-information/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5 studies about visual information processing</a> to know what will work best for you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>#2 Writing Tips</h2>
<p>If you are well-prepared for your assignment, you will find that writing the assignment will be much easier than you could imagine. The following are some of the tips on how to write a good assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #9999ff;">Introduction.</span></strong> This is the first paragraph of your assignment that gives the examiner a clear picture of whether you know what you are doing or you are just surviving in a college or university. You must know what details help you <a href="https://explorable.com/how-to-write-an-introduction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">write a good introduction</a>. Firstly, you are required to discuss the contextual background of the topic. Your arguments should be supported with citations or quotations from credible authors. To show the examiner that you understand the topic question, write down this question using your own words and explain. You should, however, avoid repeating the question word by word (a mistake made by most students). Secondly, you need to state your stand on the topic. Whether you support it or you are against it. The stand you state in the introduction cannot be changed later in the assignment. Thirdly, develop a thesis statement in the last sentence. This is the most important sentence in the assignment. If you get the thesis statement wrong, then, you can fail that particular assignment.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ff9999;">Main body.</span></strong> The main part of your assignment should specifically answer the topic question citing some pieces of evidence. There is no limit to how many paragraphs the main body should contain. However, all the paragraphs have the same structure. That is, they should introduce an idea/argument in a topic sentence, provide the evidence to support the idea, then link the idea to the thesis statement. This structure applies to all paragraphs in the main section.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #00ffff;">Conclusion.</span></strong> This part is a place where you conclude all above-mentioned in your essay based on the evidence you present. No new idea should be presented in the conclusion. You should, however, highlight areas that need further research in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#3 Post-Writing Tips</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-78" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment.png" alt="information that will be useful for your assignment" width="305" height="512" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment.png 305w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment-179x300.png 179w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>Irrespective of whether you are a native English speaker or not, you should edit and proofread your assignment. Follow the steps to polish your piece of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ff9966;">Look through the whole paper</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ff9966;">.</span> When proofreading your work, make sure that you have answered the topic question as it is required by your tutor. Once again, look at the assessment schedule. Don’t shy off from adding a few details, if you feel something is not adding up.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Check for grammar and spelling errors.</span></strong> Going through your paper gives you a chance to correct any silly grammar errors and spelling mistakes.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ffcc;">Double check the citations.</span></strong> Have you used any citations in your assignment? Now, check if you have cited the sources correctly according to APA, MLA or Harvard guidelines. A wrong citation will deduct your marks. Moreover, you may be accused of plagiarism. Don’t expect to experience it? You’re able to avoid all issues by proofreading your work thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know all the effective tips on how to write an assignment, nothing can stop you from getting the good grades. It is worth to put enough time into all the stages &#8211; pre-writing, writing, and post-writing. Good luck!</p>

<h2>How to Write a Report-Type Assignment: 9 Key Elements to Consider</h2>
<p>A report is a short, well-planned, concise document written to address a specific purpose (to analyze a situation or issue) and audience (educators, a chief, subordinates, etc.) When writing a report, you should ensure that you address the highlighted issue adequately, providing evidence for each and every fact you mention. <span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you struggle with any of these steps or don&#8217;t have the time to complete the assignment, you may consider using a </span><a href="https://domyassignments.com/service.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homework writing service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> If you ask, “How to write my report?” the following points will be useful for you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Title Page.</span></strong> Every paper should have the name given to a particular type of work. You can learn <a href="https://writing.markfullmer.com/academic-style-titles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">how to write academic-style titles</a> from Mark Fullmer, a teacher of English writing 101/102. If we are speaking about a report, you should state it in the title. Other details that you may need to include are your name, the university, and the date of submission if you are a student. And if you’re a worker who prepares a report for a chief, don’t forget to mention the organization&#8217;s name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a look at the example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/title-for-report-writing.jpg" alt="title for report writing" width="512" height="321" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/title-for-report-writing.jpg 512w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/title-for-report-writing-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Executive summary report.</span></strong> A good report should have a summary that is approximately ½ of a page. The main details that should be included are a briefing on the main ideas discussed in the report, the analysis methods used, findings, and conclusions/recommendations, if any. It is important to clarify this so that your tutor/chief understands what you are doing right from the start of the report.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Table of content.</span></strong> There should be a page of your report where a list of chapters/subsections with headlines and the page numbers are presented. Make this guide useful for your readers as they will easily find what they will be interested in, whether the findings or research methods chapters.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">List of abbreviations and symbols.</span></strong> If you are writing, for example, a technical report, there should be a separate list of the abbreviations used in your report. The technical language can be comprehensible for you and your professor, but others will struggle with most <a href="https://techterms.com/category/technical" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">technical terms</a>. Moreover, if you use some formulas for calculating, provide these symbols in this list as well.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Introduction.</span></strong> The first chapter of your report should introduce the topic under discussion, some known information, and your approaches to the topic and how they relate to the other works.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">The main body.</span></strong> A good report, the topic of which is well-researched, should have 3 sections in the main part &#8211; methods, results, and discussion. In this part, you should include the research methods that are used and procedures that are followed to achieve the results of your analysis, then, you are also required to discuss your findings.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Conclusions and recommendations.</span></strong> The concluding chapter should include an overview of the main ideas discussed in the report. Highlight your most central findings without including new ideas. Additionally, you can make suggestions for further research in the field you report on.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Reference list.</span></strong> Every academic paper should have references, and there is no exemption when writing a report. Even if you are supposed to consider a particular subject on your own, you can’t escape from someone’s findings or ideas. Provide a list of the sources you consulted when conducting your research. Details to be included in the <a href="https://unilearning.uow.edu.au/academic/4div.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reference list</a> are the data of all books, papers, reports, etc., you refer to in the text. In general, all sources are listed in alphabetical order by the surname of the author.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Appendices.</span></strong> This section comprises all derivations, details, schemes, and listings that make your research/analysis in-depth. You may ask why it is necessary to separate this section. Can you imagine how boring it will be to read your report when there are tables, tables, and schemes on its pages? There is such a page for that purpose, but it is not always obligatory to have it in reports.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Make a Good Report: 5 Skills Needed</h2>
<p>You may think that you need just a pen and a piece of paper to write a report. Indeed, you must have a set of skills to complete this assignment successfully. What are they?</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #00ffcc;">The skill to estimate adequately the time needed to complete the assignment.</span></strong> Usually, a student may procrastinate till the last minute as he/she is sure that it is a very easy task to write a report. Or vice versa &#8211; he/she believes this work requires much time. As a result, they spend a week or even weeks entirely on writing a report. What happens, then? Demotivation in studying and a ‘jumpy’ eye are guaranteed to you. As you understand, you should apply all <a href="https://www.coachingpositiveperformance.com/17-essential-time-management-skills/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">essential time management skills</a> to boost your productivity.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #00ffcc;">The skill to define the scope of the study.</span></strong> A full understanding of the field of study is very important, but it plays into your hands when you know all the points that should be covered in the research project. So, it has to be defined at a preliminary stage of writing a report to arrive at more logical findings/conclusions. Outline the limitations of your study and the data specifications for your research paper.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #00ffcc;">The researching skills.</span></strong> The research process involves finding out more about the topic under the question. What does it include in researching? Firstly, using effective tools to collect information. Secondly, refining search queries to obtain better research results. Thirdly, evaluate information found in different sources based on accuracy, validity, and appropriateness for your report. If you have all these skills, you are close to professional report writing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if you don&#8217;t have the time or the skills to complete the assignment? In this case, you can use a &#8220;do my homework&#8221; service to help you with your report. These services can provide expert assistance with research, analysis, and writing to help you produce a high-quality report that meets your requirements and deadlines.
