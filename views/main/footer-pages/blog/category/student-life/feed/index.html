<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-reasons-why-students-should-not-have-homework">What are the reasons why students should not have homework?</h2>



<p>Should schools abolish homework? Many students, teachers, and parents are troubled by this question. While educators may see it as testing the student&#8217;s mastery of concepts in the classroom, students are likely to perceive it as a way of persecution. There have been some cases of teachers giving assignments more than students can handle, leading to the need to remove the idea from academia. Here are some reasons why homework ought to be banned.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Homework interrupts the normal sleep cycle of the students</strong><br>Teachers usually only care a little about the student&#8217;s needs outside of academic performance. Most give assignments that compel the students to stay up for long hours, with some sitting up as late as 2 am. Such burdens contribute to irregular sleep patterns, interfering with the biological clock.</li>



<li><strong>There is no real benefit in the learning process</strong><br>Teachers assume that giving students a lot of homework tasks equates to better academic performance. However, this is not the case, as most students end up demoralized. <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the other cons of homework.</span> The assignments end up driving them into a corner, becoming a devil rather than a motivation for them to learn more.</li>



<li><strong>Homework stresses students</strong><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the homework cons, it is important to mention that a</span>ccording to a study by Stanford University, 56 percent of students believe that homework is an excellent source of stress. Indeed, failure to have assignments means no anxiety or other forms of pressure for the student. They don&#8217;t have to waste long hours at their desks or battle burnout just because they have to complete tasks.</li>



<li><strong>Homework harms exam performance</strong><br>Teachers give assignments in the hope that the students get a chance to master their skills to pass the examinations. However, the opposite takes place. Students invest a lot of time doing assignments to the extent that they must allocate time for their studies. As a result, they end up failing tests.</li>



<li><strong>Writing is a technique that is beyond the majority of students</strong><br>Academic assignments usually involve substantial inscription assignments. Writing requires an individual to hone several skills, sometimes above average for students. With the teachers providing little help to the learners, writing becomes a colossal nightmare, reinforcing the need to have homework banned from the education system.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-students-have-homework-pros-and-cons-of-school-assignments">Should students have homework? Pros and cons of school assignments</h2>



<p>As you read why should students have homework articles, consider the pros and cons before making a final decision. This is because the issue has grown to be a household topic, with parents and students looking for ways to help distinguish the concept from the academic system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-pros-why-students-should-have-homework-include-the-following">The pros why students should have homework include the following:</h3>



<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the pros of homework, let’s mention that a</span>ssignment enables the students to practice and master the core skills of their majors. Even though it might be time-consuming, daily practice ensures the student can master the significant concepts of the topic under discussion.</li>



<li>It creates an environment for the parent and the child to develop a better relationship. As the parent helps the student complete school assignments, they form a close connection involving the guardian in the child&#8217;s academic journey.</li>



<li>The student gets to learn and practice the skills of task scheduling. Homework assignments are restricted to time. Hence, the student gets a chance to learn task management skills.</li>



<li>Homework enables the teachers to gauge whether the student has been able to master the concepts being taught in class. As a result, it helps educators tailor the teaching program to the learner&#8217;s needs.</li>



<li>It allows students to tap into their interests, hobbies, and talents. Homework assignments enable students to access and unlock their imaginativeness and build skills in other areas that might be useful for their development.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cons-of-school-homework-include-the-following">The cons of school homework include the following:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Homework promotes physical inactivity, leading to the occurrence of lifestyle diseases.</li>



<li>It deprives the students of the time to relax and re-energize for other activities. As a result, the learner ends up living a life of exhaustion and without the motivation to continue working hard.</li>



<li>There needs to be sufficient proof that homework boosts students&#8217; performance. Despite taking a lot of personal time, no reliable study has linked homework to good performance.</li>



<li>Homework assignments can be overwhelming for students, denying them a chance to enjoy their free time to explore other areas of life.</li>



<li>Homework needs to be more balanced. Teachers provide extra assignments, forcing the students to spend more than three hours completing the work. Such a scenario is overdoing and prevents the students from focusing on other academic and personal growth areas.</li>



<li>It promotes a culture of poor work-life balance. This leads to the nurturing of student professionals who hold little importance for social life. Perhaps this is one of the primary reasons why students should not have homework.</li>



<li>Homework creates unfairness between children with parents who help with those who don&#8217;t.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reasons-why-students-should-have-less-homework">Reasons why students should have less homework</h2>



<p>Too much work is a perennial complaint from most students. Here are reasons why learners should get lesser homework: </p>



<p><strong>#1 Less homework encourages students to learn</strong></p>



<p>The school aims to teach students and make them love learning. Teachers should look for ways that make their audience appreciate being in school and always look forward to other lessons. Hence, the homework assignments should be less thought-provoking to ensure students are motivated to study.</p>



<p><strong>#2 To support mindfulness </strong></p>



<p>A balanced workload promotes mindfulness. Less work means a reduced amount of stress. As a result, the students get sufficient time to rest and build on other areas of personal growth.</p>



<p><strong>#3 Students get time for adequate rest and sleep </strong></p>



<p>Young students require time to rest and digest new skills and concepts. Teachers must understand that the children are in the stage of growth and discovery. Therefore, they should provide minimal assignments to stay focused on their academic journey.</p>



<p><strong>#4 To allow the children time out of academia </strong></p>



<p>Children need time to grow and connect with their friends and parents personally. As a result, there is a need to give them time to explore other areas of interest and ensure they are active and ready for the next school lesson. The teachers must consider this and provide minimal assignments.</p>



<p><strong>#5 To protect student&#8217;s self-esteem </strong></p>



<p>Teachers usually <a href="https://domyassignments.com/">do my homework assignments</a> and award grades. Some students score less and may feel unworthy, leading to low self-esteem. Based on this, teachers should reduce the number of assignments to ensure all children have the highest self-esteem and grow to be the people they dream of being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>Homework is tedious for students. Even though no student has the guts to stand up and refuse to take on the task, it is evident that they are suffering from the arrangement. This article has presented both perspectives in terms of the assignments. Therefore, it will be an eye-opener to the key stakeholders and fuel changes in the education sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fa-qs">FAQs</h2>



<p><b>Should homework be banned? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p></p>
<cite><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate on whether should homework be banned pros and cons, and other issues is complex and has reasonable arguments in both camps. All those people who advocate banning homework argue that it can lead to stress, anxiety, and even burnout. At the same time, proponents of home assignments argue that tasks reinforce the process of learning, help boost discipline, as well as prepare undergrads for the commitments of post-college life</span></cite></blockquote>



<p><b>Are there any alternatives to traditional homework assignments?&nbsp;</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p></p>
<cite><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who wonder ​​should student have homework or not should consider alternatives to conventional homework tasks, such as project-based learning (undergrads engage in hands-on projects that apply materials learned in class), flipped learning (undergrads watch instructional videos to discuss later in the class), and interactive online platforms that together make the process of learning more interesting and enjoyable.</span></cite></blockquote>

<p>Now, let’s see what measures can be undertaken to be highly motivated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #2ecc71;">Think positive</span></strong>. Never forget that motivation strongly depends on our feelings and emotions. Therefore, have a positive attitude towards life in general and things you have to do in particular. They help to maintain strength and enthusiasm to complete essays and other projects quickly and effectively.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Set goals.</span></strong> It’s important to plainly understand what you are to complete and in what sequence. Therefore, you’d better set clear goals and fulfill them logically and effectively. Make the prioritization of your goals. Think which ones are more important and urgent. They should be your priority. The others can be finished later. Setting goals is one of the most effective motivational methods.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">Be a realist</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffccff;">.</span> No matter how enthusiastic you want to become, you should be down to earth. <span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you wonder how to get motivated to study in a minute, you better stop. </span> When you set objectives, you ought to be totally sure that you’ll be able to manage them. Thus, you shouldn’t add to your schedule the accomplishment of 10 essays during the day when your best result is 5 essays. If you cannot reach an objective, you risk losing your motivation for good.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #33ccff;">Control your time.</span></strong> Don’t delay until the last hour. Time has great value, and it’s one of the things that motivate people. Make a reasonable schedule for the entire week. Make sure you enlist all the tasks and duties you have to fulfill. Prioritize them and set a clear deadline. Use some effective techniques that help to write assignments really fast. The notion that you fully control your time will enhance your self-confidence and thus, your motivation.</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #99ff00;">Avoid distractions.</span></strong> Another point you need to know is the power of distractions, especially if you’re someone looking for ways to get motivated to study but get distracted by any phone notification or noise from the street. Unfortunately, many people don’t even realize that some things they undertake day and night may lead them to the loss of motivation. If you constantly play video games, you will not have a spark of motivation to write even the easiest paper. Therefore, pay attention to your routine activities, reevaluate their importance, and avoid doing things that distract you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Stay Motivated In College?</h2>
<p>Life in a college differs from life at school. There are more and more disciplines, and the demands of professors are higher and more complicated. That’s why students ought to use all possible motivational methods to be focused and determined to meet their academic objectives. The question of how to be motivated to do homework is more and more crucial since the overload doesn’t seem to get any less challenging. You’re welcome to use the prompts from the previous block. Additionally, we suggest a few more.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive;"><strong><a href="https://sidsavara.com/how-to-get-motivated-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Find your mantra</a>.</strong></span> It may be weird enough, but many students get highly superstitious and begin to believe in a lot of strange things. Thus, they believe that if they choose some motto and repeat it every day, it helps them. Thus, you may choose a special mantra to always be motivated.<br />
For example, an expression “You miss 100% shots if you don’t take a single shot” is really effective. You never know whether you would be able to cope with some tasks if you never try it. Therefore, you ought to take even some immature steps to see how good or bad you are. It will be the initial push, which will kindle your motivation. Find your own mantra, search for quotes of famous people, and stick to them.</li>
<li><strong><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive;">Take care of yourself.</span> </strong>It’s of great importance to follow a healthy lifestyle. People with some diseases or health deviations aren’t motivated at all. Such people don’t have enough strength (both physical and mental) to fulfill even the easiest tasks. Therefore, take care of yourself. It should be done in all possible ways. Eat healthy food and maintain a healthy sleep. Refuse heavy meals and snacks. Sleep not less than 8 hours every day. You should likewise exercise on a daily basis, don’t drink too much caffeine, and something of the kind.</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive;"><strong>Get rewarded.</strong></span> Another thing that motivates is self-rewarding. Every accomplished paper is a small win. Don’t deprive yourself of something pleasant. Reward yourself after you complete some complex assignments or when you finish a lot of small duties. If you like journeys, take a trip at the weekend. If you like sweets, buy them to satisfy your appetites, etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive;"><strong>Get support.</strong></span> You need a shoulder to lean on! Remember this simple but important measure.  You may lose interest in everything, and if there’s no support, there is a great risk to lose emotional stability. A few friends may rescue your loss of motivation.<br />
Your friends may simply remind you that you should never give up and serve as a live example of determination and inspiration. In return, try to motivate your friends too. Thus, you will receive a great motivational goal to remain focused and organized.Besides, don’t forget about online help from academic writing websites. When people lose motivation, it takes some time to regain it. It may be a quite durable process. In the meanwhile, you still have a lot of papers to write. Therefore, it’s important to have some dependable support while you try to overcome your emotional complications. Professional experts will easily tackle any assignment you may have. They will reach the required level to create a perfect piece. Thus, you will receive the highest grades without much effort. Besides, it may motivate you to follow their example and compose your own masterpieces.</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive;"><strong>Inspire yourself every day.</strong></span> Finally, you are supposed to be inspired every day. You can do it with the help of other people, as well as secure it on your own. Undertake things you really love, which can motivate and encourage you. These may be your hobbies, or you may try to master some new skills. After you reach a good result, your mood will be enhanced, and all the obstacles won’t seem that bad.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Know Your Personal Best Ways to Motivate Yourself to Study?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have no motivation to do homework college professors assigns, it is important to come up with the best ways to get motivated for academic work. Now that you know how to become motivated to study be sure to find your personal techniques that will work for you exclusively. First of all, you need to know what kind of person you are and what your preferred study methods and habits are.

<p>Memorize these recommendations to stay motivated. They are suitable for all life situations and especially for studying. Use them every time you feel unmotivated and just to prevent loss of motivation while you learn.</p>
<h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7-Inspirational-Quotes-to-Motivate-Yourself.png" alt="7 Inspirational Quotes to Motivate Yourself" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-221" srcset="https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7-Inspirational-Quotes-to-Motivate-Yourself.png 960w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7-Inspirational-Quotes-to-Motivate-Yourself-300x200.png 300w, https://domyassignments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7-Inspirational-Quotes-to-Motivate-Yourself-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, the 2018 year is drawing to a close, and now, it is a good time to reflect on what it has been like as well as what you would like the following year to be in terms of academic success, private achievements, and professional development. Did you manage to do everything you wanted to do this year? Were you able to fulfill your dreams? Was it a good year? Whether it was or not, it is high time to think of some ways to make sure the next year is going to be better in all respects.</p>
<p><span id="more-209"></span></p>
<p>In this article, you&rsquo;ll get familiar with the best motivational quotes to get you started and keep you going for the entire year &ndash; so, read on and recharge yourself with energy to achieve everything you desire.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">&ldquo;A dream doesn&#39;t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Colin Powell</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">At a glance, this idea doesn&rsquo;t do a very good job of psyching one up for an exciting and successful year. After all, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we were able to achieve our dreams by merely wishing them to become true? However, there is another way to think about it all. Consider this: have all the successful people achieved what they have not through blind luck but via consistent and constant application of time and efforts? This means there is no such thing as pre-determined success or failure. You may feel down right now, you may think that you are by definition unable to achieve what you desire. But if you take this quote to heart, this will mean that there is no such thing as an unsalvageable situation. By applying yourself, you can achieve anything &ndash; just don&rsquo;t give up too soon.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#2ecc71">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you came from. All that matters is where you are going&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Brian Tracy</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">So what if the last year wasn&rsquo;t as successful and exciting as you wanted it to be? When it comes to achievements, what you were able to do in the past doesn&rsquo;t have to determine what you will do in the future. Even if you spend an inordinate amount of time working and struggling with yourself for meager returns, things don&rsquo;t have to always be this way. If you really set a goal for yourself and really put every effort into achieving it, you will be able to do it, even if you don&rsquo;t have a long history of success.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#cc99ff">&ldquo;Write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The 1st of January may be a traditional day for the new beginnings and making new year resolutions, but you don&rsquo;t have to wait for any specific date to start changing your life. There will never be a better day than today &ndash; both a better day in general and a better day to do something. Don&rsquo;t wait! Feel happiness now, don&rsquo;t put things off. Don&rsquo;t wait for a better time to start something. In some way, every day of your life is the best &ndash; so make sure to find what makes it so.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#ccff00">&ldquo;Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Helen Keller</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Being happy may be difficult, especially if there is nothing to be happy about in your life. However, it works both ways. If you meticulously look for reasons to be happy instead of reasons to feel down (like most of us do), you will find them. Most things we encounter aren&rsquo;t necessarily black or white &ndash; it depends on how we decide to look at them. If you make it your purpose in life to be happy and use every opportunity to be so, you will find that there is more happiness to go around than you could have ever believed. And being happy will make you more resilient against all the bad things that life throws your way.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#00ccff">&ldquo;All of us every single year, we&rsquo;re a different person. I don&rsquo;t think we are the same person all our lives&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Steven Spielberg</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">And if it is so, then stepping into the next year is an excellent reason to become a different, better person than you were last year. Who you are isn&rsquo;t set in stone anywhere &ndash; tomorrow, you don&rsquo;t have to have all the faults you had yesterday. It is in your power to change things and to change yourself &ndash; if you decide so.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#ff9999">&ldquo;Whatever you do or dream you can do &ndash; begin it. Boldness has genius and power and magic in it&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you haven&rsquo;t done anything like this in the past &ndash; everything has to be done for the first time. Remember that nobody ever regrets having tried to do something. What people usually regret is not having tried. It doesn&rsquo;t matter even if you succeed or fail. If you try something new and succeed, good for you! You achieve what you want! If you try something new and fail, good for you as well! You receive valuable experience and will do better next time.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#99cccc">&ldquo;A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align:right"><em>Albert Einstein</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t be afraid of making mistakes. The only person who never makes mistakes is the one who never does anything and never achieves anything in life. If you don&rsquo;t want to end up like this, be ready to go out of your comfort zone and do things that are new and unfamiliar to you. You will certainly end up making some blunders to begin with, but it is the only way to learn and get better. The less you are afraid of mistakes, the more interesting, full and enjoyable your life will become. So make sure you feel positive about them!</p>
<p>When you think about the year that is about to pass and the coming one, it is important not to just reflect on them but to express your thoughts in a more material form &ndash; for example, in writing. It is often said that your thoughts don&rsquo;t actually become real until you write them down. You can think about something for as long as you like. But if you want your thoughts to actually have some impact on your life, you have to put them on paper. That is why it is so important to signify the end and the beginning of the year by taking some time to get your thoughts into order. Write on the topics that will help you understand better what you did over the past year and what you want to do over the one that comes after it. Some of the topics you may consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">For me, 2018 was the year of &hellip;;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I want 2019 to be the year of &hellip;;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How can I improve my life in 2019;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If I could make one my wish come true in 2019, what would it be?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What was my favorite part of 2018?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">We hope that after reading this, it will be easier for you to feel excited about the new year and prepare yourself for all kinds of new achievements, academic and otherwise!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Looking to celebrate the New Year with a bang? The New Year&rsquo;s Eve is the best holiday of the year, and the perfect time to meet friends and family to say farewell to the past year. It&rsquo;s actually a non-stop party, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive for students. Right? </p>
<p/>
<span id="more-189"></span></p>
<p>There is nothing better on the New Year&rsquo;s Eve than a party with all your closest friends. And with a few money-saving tricks and creative ideas. You can make this evening special by hosting a great New Year&rsquo;s party on a budget that your friends will remember for years &#8211; from food and decorations to games and refreshments. You can cut costs without sacrificing the fun. Here are 5 tips on how to make the New Year&rsquo;s holidays memorable.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#2ecc71">#1 Host Your Party at Home</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is no need to go out to a bar to have a great time. You can keep the festivities at home, and it can be much cheaper and more comfortable for everyone. Good friends, good wine, and good food are all you need to have a fantastic party. You are unlikely to be able to invite all your Facebook friends. So, you should limit your list to the closest friends. In this way, you&rsquo;ll spend less money and will be able to connect with all your guests and really enjoy the New Year&rsquo;s celebration.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#3399ff">#2 Plan a Frugal Menu</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is no need to make a big meal. You can ask your guests to have dinner before arriving. As a result, you won&rsquo;t have to buy food and cook. Or you can ask everyone to bring a dish, an appetizer, a dessert or a favorite drink. If someone of your guests doesn&rsquo;t know how to cook or what to bring, you can suggest, for example, a cheese and cracker plate, a nut and fruit platter or raw veggies and hummus. This strategy can liven up your party because your guests will have <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/recipes/g1078/new-years-food/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a variety of tasty food</a> and drink to try. You will need champagne for toasting the dawn of the New Year, but you should also have other alcoholic beverages as well as non-alcoholic beverages (for designated drivers). If you want to cut down on champagne costs, a good idea is to make orange, strawberry or cranberry punch or champagne sangria. You can find a lot of <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/1576/the-12-drinks-of-christmas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recipes of delicious and festive drinks</a> on the web.</p>
<p>A baked potato bar is an easy and inexpensive solution for a midnight supper. All you have to do is to bake big potatoes and serve them with different toppings such as chili, mushrooms, butter, sour cream, steamed broccoli, shredded cheese or anything else you would like. Follow the baked potatoes with a dessert. For example, you may serve a chocolate cake, ice cream, and coffee. If you want to spend more money, you can make a <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/cheesecake" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cheesecake</a>. Another inexpensive way to feed your guests is a cheese-and-cracker tray. Besides, you can order pizza or turn the New Year&rsquo;s Eve into a fondue party.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">#3 Decorate Your Home with Handmade Crafts</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sparkling decorations can add to the excitement of the night. You don&rsquo;t have to spend a bunch of cash on the New Year&rsquo;s decor. You can reuse decorations from the past events and parties that you hosted last year or buy them at a dollar store. You can also make handmade decorations to add festive touches around your home. Actually, it&rsquo;s a great way to make this night memorable. You can mix them with traditional holiday decorations for an extra special look. Just make sure your <a href="http://www.woohome.com/diy-2/top-32-sparkling-diy-decoration-ideas-for-new-years-eve-party" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DIY decorations</a> have a lot of sparkles. For example, you can cover your bottles of champagne in glitter, tape giant confetti to your walls, hang paper snowflakes from the ceiling or make origami stars. &nbsp;The main thing is to make everything glitter &ndash; golden balloons, star garlands, table setting. If you need inspiration or lack creativity, look for creative DIY New Year decoration ideas on the Internet.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#9999ff">#4 Plan Free Entertainment</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Music will help you create the perfect party mood, and you can dance the night away listening to your favorite music. For example, you can use Spotify to find great pre-created playlists or create your own one according to your preferences. Just don&rsquo;t forget to add some dance-worthy songs into the mix. Having a dance party is the best option to keep everybody awake to watch the ball drop. You should also plan some <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/new-years-eve-party-games-adults-1357908" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">engaging group activities</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can play different games while you are waiting for the ball to drop.</strong> There are a lot of options to have fun &ndash; playing a multi-player video game, a game of cards or a board game. You can make it a mix of everyone&rsquo;s favorite games and have a lot of fun having a little friendly competition.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ask your guests to bring unusual noisemakers and have a contest.</strong> Vote who wins and award a prize to the winner, something like earmuffs. When the clock strikes midnight, you can create your own symphony of clatter, racket, and boom.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can ask your friends to write predictions for the New Year and put them into a box or a bowl.</strong> You can read these predictions during the midnight supper and try to guess who wrote them. You are sure to have a lot of fun because it will be rather difficult to guess who made every prediction.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A good idea is to create a photo montage of important things</strong> that happened to your friends and you during the past year or make a short video and watch it together to enjoy your precious memories.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can ask everyone to write their <a href="https://www.dollarsprout.com/new-years-resolution-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New Year resolutions for 2019</a> and take turns to read them.</strong> You can discuss these resolutions, share your ideas on how to make them stick and help each other make plans to achieve their goals. Chances are that some of your friends have similar goals so they can become partners for each other. Besides, you can ask everyone to put their resolutions in the jar and keep it until the next New Year&rsquo;s Eve to check if everyone will have achieved their goals.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A movie marathon is an easy way to stay occupied while waiting for the New Year.</strong> You can watch tons of shows and movies together with your friends for free if someone has a Netflix or Amazon Prime account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="background-color:#00ffcc">#5 Make a Photo Booth</span></h2>
<p>Photo booths are hot but renting one can be expensive. You can set it up if you designate a special area for your guests where they can take photos. You just can hang a sheet or a tablecloth for a backdrop and provide a camera and some props like old-fashioned hats, large glasses, shawls, scarves, and boas that your friends can use. It&rsquo;s a great way to document a party, and your friends can post those photos online to share.</p>
<p>Throwing your own New Year&rsquo;s Eve party can be a lot of work but with proper planning, it can also bring an enormous amount of fun if you keep an eye on the budget. Use our easy tips to have a great holiday party without breaking the bank.</p>
